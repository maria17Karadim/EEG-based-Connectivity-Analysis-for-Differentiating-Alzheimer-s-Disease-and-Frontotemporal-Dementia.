  <h2>🧠 Introduction</h2>

  <p>
    Dementia represents a critical and growing challenge to global health, with
    <strong>Alzheimer’s Disease (AD)</strong> and
    <strong>Frontotemporal Dementia (FTD)</strong> being among the most prevalent and
    debilitating forms. These neurodegenerative disorders cause a progressive
    decline in cognitive function, profoundly affecting patients’ quality of life
    while placing substantial emotional, social, and economic burdens on caregivers
    and healthcare systems.
  </p>

  <p>
    One of the most significant clinical challenges lies in the
    <strong>accurate differentiation between AD, FTD, and normal aging</strong>.
    Although these conditions often present with overlapping symptoms during their
    early stages, they differ markedly in their underlying neuropathological
    mechanisms and disease progression. Early and reliable diagnosis is therefore
    essential for effective intervention and disease management.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Electroencephalography (EEG)</strong> has emerged as a powerful,
    non-invasive, and cost-effective technique for assessing brain function.
    Unlike neuroimaging modalities that primarily provide structural information,
    EEG captures neural activity with millisecond-level temporal resolution,
    offering a direct window into the functional brain networks disrupted by
    neurodegeneration.
  </p>

  <p>
    In this context, <strong>functional connectivity analysis</strong>—which evaluates
    statistical dependencies between neural signals across different brain regions—
    has shown strong potential for revealing disease-specific network alterations.
    AD is commonly associated with widespread disruptions in long-range connectivity,
    whereas FTD predominantly affects frontal and temporal network integrity.
  </p>

  <p>
    Traditional EEG analysis approaches typically rely on handcrafted features
    combined with classical machine learning algorithms, such as
    <em>Random Forests</em>, <em>Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)</em>,
    <em>Radial Basis Function (RBF)</em> kernel methods, and
    <em>Naïve Bayes</em> classifiers. More recently, deep learning techniques,
    particularly <em>Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)</em>, have been explored as
    an alternative paradigm for automated EEG signal analysis.
  </p>

  <p>
    Both classical machine learning and deep learning approaches offer complementary
    strengths in extracting meaningful patterns from EEG data. Building upon these
    methodologies, this thesis aims to <strong>develop and compare hybrid frameworks</strong>
    that integrate conventional machine learning techniques with CNN-based models,
    specifically tailored for resting-state EEG recordings.
  </p>

  <p>
    The primary objective is to automatically distinguish between
    <strong>AD, FTD, and healthy control subjects</strong> while identifying robust,
    interpretable EEG biomarkers that support early and accurate differential diagnosis.
    Ultimately, this research seeks to provide a supplementary diagnostic tool to
    assist clinicians in delivering timely, objective assessments and improving
    patient care and management outcomes.
