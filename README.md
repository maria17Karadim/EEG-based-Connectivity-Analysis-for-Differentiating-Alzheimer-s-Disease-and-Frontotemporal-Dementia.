  <h2>🧠 Introduction</h2>

  <p>
    🌍 <strong>Dementia</strong> represents a critical and growing challenge to global
    health, with <strong>Alzheimer’s Disease (AD)</strong> 🧩 and
    <strong>Frontotemporal Dementia (FTD)</strong> 🧠 being among the most prevalent and
    debilitating forms. These neurodegenerative disorders lead to a gradual decline
    in cognitive function, significantly impacting patients’ quality of life 💔 while
    placing substantial demands on caregivers 👩‍⚕️👨‍⚕️ and healthcare systems.
  </p>

  <p>
    ⚠️ One of the major clinical challenges lies in the
    <strong>accurate differentiation between AD, FTD, and normal aging</strong>.
    Although these conditions often exhibit overlapping symptoms in their early
    stages ⏳, they differ considerably in their underlying mechanisms and disease
    progression 📉. Early and precise diagnosis is therefore essential for effective
    intervention and disease management 🎯.
  </p>

  <p>
    ⚡ <strong>Electroencephalography (EEG)</strong> has emerged as a powerful,
    non-invasive 🩺, and cost-effective 💡 technique for investigating brain function.
    Unlike neuroimaging methods that primarily provide structural information,
    EEG captures neural activity with millisecond-level temporal resolution ⏱️,
    offering a direct view into the functional brain networks disrupted by
    neurodegeneration.
  </p>

  <p>
    🔗 In this context, <strong>functional connectivity analysis</strong>—which examines
    statistical relationships between neural signals across different brain regions—
    has demonstrated strong potential in identifying disease-specific network
    alterations 🧬. AD is typically associated with widespread disruptions in
    long-range connectivity 🌐, whereas FTD predominantly affects frontal and
    temporal network integrity 📍.
  </p>

  <p>
    🤖 Conventional EEG analysis approaches commonly rely on handcrafted features
    combined with classical machine learning algorithms such as
    <em>Random Forests</em> 🌲, <em>Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)</em>,
    <em>Radial Basis Function (RBF)</em> kernels, and
    <em>Naïve Bayes</em> classifiers 📊.
    In parallel, deep learning techniques—particularly
    <em>Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)</em> 🧠—have emerged as an alternative
    strategy for automated EEG signal processing.
  </p>

  <p>
    🧩 Both classical machine learning and deep learning approaches offer complementary
    strengths in extracting meaningful patterns from EEG data. Building upon these
    methodologies, this thesis aims to <strong>develop and compare hybrid frameworks</strong>
    that integrate traditional machine learning techniques with CNN-based models,
    specifically tailored for resting-state EEG recordings 💤.
  </p>

  <p>
    🎯 The primary objective is to automatically distinguish between
    <strong>AD, FTD, and healthy control subjects</strong>, while identifying robust
    and interpretable EEG biomarkers 🔍 that support early and accurate differential
    diagnosis. Ultimately, this research seeks to provide a supportive diagnostic
    tool 🧪 to assist clinicians in delivering timely, objective assessments and
    improving patient care and management outcomes 🌱.
