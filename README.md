  <h1>🧠 Introduction</h1>

  <p><span class="emoji">🌍</span> Dementia represents a critical and growing challenge to global health, with <strong>Alzheimer’s Disease (AD)</strong> 🧩 and <strong>Frontotemporal Dementia (FTD)</strong> 🧠 being among the most prevalent and debilitating forms. These neurodegenerative disorders lead to a gradual decline in cognitive function, significantly impacting patients’ quality of life 💔 while placing substantial demands on caregivers 👩‍⚕️👨‍⚕️ and healthcare systems.</p>

  <p><span class="emoji">⚠️</span> One of the major clinical challenges lies in the accurate differentiation between AD, FTD, and normal aging. Although these conditions often exhibit overlapping symptoms in their early stages ⏳, they differ considerably in their underlying mechanisms and disease progression 📉. Early and precise diagnosis is therefore essential for effective intervention and disease management 🎯.</p>

  <p><span class="emoji">⚡</span> <strong>Electroencephalography (EEG)</strong> has emerged as a powerful, non-invasive 🩺, and cost-effective 💡 technique for investigating brain function. Unlike neuroimaging methods that primarily provide structural information, EEG captures neural activity with millisecond-level temporal resolution ⏱️, offering a direct view into the functional brain networks disrupted by neurodegeneration.</p>

  <p><span class="emoji">🔗</span> In this context, <strong>functional connectivity analysis</strong>—which examines statistical relationships between neural signals across different brain regions—has demonstrated strong potential in identifying disease-specific network alterations 🧬. AD is typically associated with widespread disruptions in long-range connectivity 🌐, whereas FTD predominantly affects frontal and temporal network integrity 📍.</p>

  <p><span class="emoji">🤖</span> Conventional EEG analysis approaches commonly rely on <strong>handcrafted features</strong> combined with classical machine learning algorithms such as <strong>Random Forests</strong> 🌲, <strong>Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)</strong>, <strong>Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernels</strong>, and <strong>Naïve Bayes classifiers</strong> 📊. In parallel, <strong>deep learning techniques</strong>—particularly <strong>Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)</strong> 🧠—have emerged as an alternative strategy for automated EEG signal processing.</p>

  <p><span class="emoji">🧩</span> Both classical machine learning and deep learning approaches offer complementary strengths in extracting meaningful patterns from EEG data. Building upon these methodologies, this thesis aims to develop and compare <strong>hybrid frameworks</strong> that integrate traditional machine learning techniques with CNN-based models, specifically tailored for <strong>resting-state EEG recordings</strong> 💤.</p>

  <p><span class="emoji">🎯</span> The primary objective is to automatically distinguish between AD, FTD, and healthy control subjects, while identifying robust and interpretable EEG biomarkers 🔍 that support early and accurate differential diagnosis. Ultimately, this research seeks to provide a supportive <strong>diagnostic tool</strong> 🧪 to assist clinicians in delivering timely, objective assessments and improving patient care and management outcomes 🌱.</p>
