Introduction 
Dementia represents a critical and growing challenge to global health, with Alzheimer's 
Disease (AD) and Frontotemporal Dementia (FTD) being two of the most prevalent and 
debilitating types. These neurodegenerative diseases lead to a gradual deterioration of 
cognitive abilities, significantly impacting the quality of life for patients and placing 
substantial demands on caregivers and healthcare services. A key clinical hurdle is the 
accurate distinction between AD, FTD, and normal aging—conditions that frequently share 
similar symptoms in their initial stages but differ significantly in their underlying mechanisms 
and progression. 
Electroencephalography (EEG) has gained attention as a powerful, non-invasive, and 
affordable method for examining brain function. Unlike neuroimaging techniques that 
mainly offer structural insights, EEG records neural activity with millisecond precision, 
providing a direct measure of the functional networks that are disrupted by 
neurodegeneration. Importantly, functional connectivity analysis —the evaluation of statistical 
relationships between neural signals across different brain areas—has shown potential in 
uncovering disease-specific network irregularities. AD is typically characterized by extensive 
disruptions in long-distance connectivity, while FTD primarily impacts the integrity of frontal 
and temporal networks. 
Conventional EEG analysis methods often rely on manually crafted features combined 
with traditional machine learning algorithms such as Random Forests, Linear Discriminant 
Analysis (LDA), Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel methods, and Naive Bayes classifiers. 
Deep learning approaches, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), have also been 
utilized as an alternative strategy for processing EEG data. Both classical machine learning 
and CNN techniques provide complementary methods for extracting significant patterns 
from EEG signals. 
This thesis aims to investigate and compare these methods by developing and 
implementing frameworks that merge classical machine learning techniques with CNN-based 
models, which are designed explicitly for resting-state EEG data, to differentiate between 
AD, FTD, and healthy controls automatically. The main objective is to identify strong, 
interpretable EEG biomarkers that can aid in earlier and more accurate differential diagnosis. 
Ultimately, this research seeks to provide a supplementary diagnostic tool to assist 
clinicians in delivering timely and objective evaluations, thereby improving patient care and 
management outcomes.
